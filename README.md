# PUBG-Data-Analysis

This is a group project. The aim of this project is to develop analysis on PUBG dataset captured using the PUBG Developer API. We have analyzed
different strategies of winning and compared different game modes. Analysis of different player strategies such as killing, running, driving, healing is
also done and have showed how these strategies are correlated to the player rank.

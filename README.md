# PUBG-Data-Analysis

The aim of this project is to develop analysis on PUBG dataset captured using the PUBG Developer API to predict the finishing rank of all one hundred players participating in the match based on their end game statistics. We will analyse different strategies of winning and compare and contrast in different game modes such as solos, duos and squad. Also, we will analyse different player strategies such as killing, running , driving, swimming, healing and how these strategies are correlated to the player rank (winPlacePerc).
